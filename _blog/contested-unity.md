### Imagined communities, then a nagging question

After finishing a paper on the **institution of the nation-state** (the figure above is created from the data in a related work by Andreas Wimmer), I kept circling the next question: *what do we actually mean by national identity—at least in economics?*

> “Nationalism: an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind.” — *Albert Einstein*

That line sticks because the bad reputation is not undeserved. Nationalism can mobilize solidarity—and exclusion. So what do development economists do with this tension? One impulse emphasizes a shared identity for coordination, trust, and state capacity. The other warns that nation-building can crowd out pluralism or backfire.

### A tiny taxonomy I find useful

Here’s the organizing thought behind my paper: if we accept a simple chain—

**nation-state → nation-building → (a technology of) coordination → national identity,**

—then the “technology” is just **public policy**, and in modern states the main lever is **redistribution**. In other words, identity formation isn’t mystical; it’s co-produced with the **budget choices** the state makes.

Concretely, I model a majority allocating a fixed budget each period across:
- a majority-specific good,
- a minority-specific good,
- and a **common good** (curriculum, shared language, civic programs).

The common good yields some value today *and* raises the chance of a more civic, integrated polity tomorrow. Identity is the **outcome** of this repeated bargaining over public goods, not a primitive.

### Three regimes, in plain language

- **Exclusionary.** The majority prioritizes itself. No weight on minority welfare or preferences; little to no integration effort.

- **Split / “multicultural” appeasement.** Each group gets its preferred good. The pie is divided, coordination remains costly, and everyone pays for the duplication.

- **Common-good (civic) regime.** The state invests in a **not-anyone’s-ideal** common good—civic infrastructure that can pave the way for a stronger, more legitimate welfare state later.

The paper’s point isn’t to moralize these categories, but to show **when** each emerges. Two forces do most of the work: a political trade-off (immediate group benefits vs. deterring conflict and nurturing a civic future), and intertemporal misalignment (today’s citizens undervalue tomorrow’s integration).

*This post sketches the intuition. The working paper puts the pieces into a dynamic model and traces the conditions under which polities drift toward exclusion, get stuck split, or converge to civic nationalism.*
