The image on this page is a lithograph by Eugène Flandin from 1840, titled Mamasani Tower. To most, it is an obscure work by a French orientalist. To me, it was a shock. I was born in this city. The painter’s vantage point could easily be a farm right outside the neighborhood where I grew up, facing the same mountains. The town has changed since then. There is no trace of the walled city or its castle. Yet the shrine, Imam-zadeh Darvaze Ahani, still stood in my childhood, shapeless but present, especially during ceremonies.

This painting shows a scene just outside the city walls. That is how my childhood felt. I was at the edge of the city, yet in the middle of the ties that made it what it was: working people, farms, and those moving in and out to serve, consult, or seek justice from the ruling powers. Finding this image later became a framing experience for me. It shaped how I think about development. As a teenager in Mamasani, I sensed imbalance. Some were rural, others urban. Some were prosperous, many were not. I wondered: why cannot everyone, or at least we, be prosperous? What is allowed, and who decides? These questions grew sharper as I watched the political turmoil of my youth, from 2 Khordad 1376 to the end of the Khatami era. Later, I learned the vocabulary for what I had sensed: individual behavior is not free floating. It is shaped by political structures that set the incentives. That is political economy.

One detail of the painting always catches my eye. A man with a rifle walks toward the painter, gaze sharp and inquisitorial. As a child, such a look could send me rushing home, afraid of being questioned. Flandin, a French visitor mapping the ruins of an exotic Orient, did not need to answer to him. His safety and distance remind me that many of the lenses we still use to study development were built from outside the frame. European portrayals were sometimes accurate and sometimes not, but they became the starting point. Mainstream economic theories of development often work in the same way. They offer a powerful lens and a narrative. They are a useful starting point, but not the destination.

What Flandin could not know, and what I still do not know fully, are the relationships that shaped the destiny of this land. Who were these people? How were they tied to each other? What did they produce, who kept the harvest, who took the lion’s share, and who commanded the rifles? I can guess that the walled city was ruled by one of the tribes in the region, but not a representative one. Such affiliations determined the fate of the town. These are not background details. They are the hidden structures that channel incentives and determine outcomes. Economics does not yet give us ready made answers to these questions. But it can aim at them, if we look deeper into history, identity, and relationships.

That is why I keep this image on my homepage. It reminds me to begin at the edge, looking in. To notice the people outside the walls. To use the tools of economics to clarify, but also to move beyond them, into the lived arrangements that give rules their force.
