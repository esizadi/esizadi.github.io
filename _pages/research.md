### Political Connections and Firm Performance in Indonesia: Evidence from a Novel Dataset on Political Connections (with Addisu Lashitew, Rizal Shidiq and Eric Werker)
An empirical microeconomics study on financial performance of firms with political connections. This Research sheds new lights on an important relationship between frims and political parties, showing how powerful connections can facilitate better access to credit resulting in higher profitability. We also show how these effects are almost entirely limited to industries with a more competitive nature, showing how even powerful connections do not gaurantee a better performance if firms are not well-positioned to use their higher leverage ratios. Our study has also methodological contributions as we utilize a Two Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) approach based on a new semi-exogenous configuration of variations in political connections of firms, in addition to a novel instrumental variable strategy that captures the local variations in political connections coming from change in power of political parties. 

### Nation-State Building (with Chris Bidner)
**Abstract.** We develop a simple dynamic theory of Nation-States in which Elites choose investments in both State-building and Nation-building. In our approach nation-building works towards homogenization of citizens by making it easier for them to coordinate and demand for more frequent redistributions. A more coordinated citizenry will accept lower transfers in the current period, making it possible for the Elites to pacify their threats. Our mechanism puts the emphasis on social conflicts rather than external threats in the emergence of nation-building investments. It also highlights the role of nation-building in changing the (coordination) technology rather than altering the preferences and indoctrinating the citizens. We define state capacity with its role in lowering the cost of redistribution and show how investments in nation-building can incentivize the Elite to further invest in state-building. Nation-State building is thus embodiment of this complementarity.

### Contested Unity
A novel dynamic game theoretic model of examining how societies with cultural and income divisions can transition to or away from an inclusive national identity.
