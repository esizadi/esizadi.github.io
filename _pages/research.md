## Political Economy of Development

### Nation-State Building (with Chris Bidner)
#### Abstract.
We develop a simple dynamic theory of Nation-States in which Elites choose investments in both State-building and Nation-building. In our approach nation-building works towards homogenization of citizens by making it easier for them to coordinate and demand for more frequent redistributions. A more coordinated citizenry will accept lower transfers in the current period, making it possible for the Elites to pacify their threats. Our mechanism puts the emphasis on social conflicts rather than external threats in the emergence of nation-building investments. It also highlights the role of nation-building in changing the (coordination) technology rather than altering the preferences and indoctrinating the citizens. We define state capacity with its role in lowering the cost of redistribution and show how investments in nation-building can incentivize the Elite to further invest in state-building. Nation-State building is thus embodiment of this complementarity.

   
### Nation-Building: Institutional vs Cultural Theory
#### Abstract.
This review paper starts by showing why national identity matters for reasons related to both economic development and contemporary politics. It then reviews the existing literature and divides them into two broad categories of modernisation and institutional theories. It shows how 'indoctrination' hypothesis is the cornerstone of modernisation theories and assesses the implications of theory for empirical works. This research makes a case for importance of the institutional theory. In this view nation building is an institutional solution to the social conflicts that led to the emergence of the nation-states. Building on this view, some further research ideas are proposed.
